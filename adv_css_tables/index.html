            <p>After months of speculation and public displays of distrust, James Harden is no longer with the team he called his "first choice" as recently as 2022: the Philadelphia 76ers.
                The LA Clippers acquired Harden in a blockbuster trade with the Sixers early Tuesday morning, sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.

               <p>Dusty Baker's managerial career officially ended Thursday, with a news release and news conference and all the trimmings that come with the end of a career of one of the rarefied few who reach a place of accomplishment as distinctive as Baker.</p>

            <p>The football and futbol worlds are far more similar than fans of either sport generally want to admit. Most of the time when I say that, I am talking about the territorial nature of the sports, or teams' extensive histories and regional ties, or, often, the rampant and frustrating inequality baked into both sports. But it also applies to an obsession about the future.</p>
